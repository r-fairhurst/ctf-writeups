directory traversal attack, the hint to it was in line 281


flag 2:
on line 300 it checks for Thr33lonMusk as a user
this is at address, http://thritter.ctf-league.osusec.org/verified
adding a cookie as name = user and value = Thr33lonMusk and then refreshing gives us the flag: osu{but_my_blue_check}


flag 3: 
the random seed is hardcoded 0

copy and pasting the randomizing code for the session id gets us this, on my windows machine it gave me something different: 98552F61E2726
then another teammate did the same thing on python tutor, and got this:
66334873643C9869327B23C66B8B4567

so i copy and pasted my code and ran it on osu servers and got the correct session

then going to http://thritter.ctf-league.osusec.org/mythreets

and changing the cookie value for session to the value above, and refreshing gets us this: 
osu{you_just_witnessed_the_strength_of_threet_knowledge}


flag 4

we need to add 3 threets first - these do not matter, just 3 random threets

we have a session, and we want to overflow likes, the struct session has the threets, then likes variables

decimal to hex
1633840489 = 0x61626d69
1633969523 = 0x61646573
1919299174 = 0x72662e66


hex to decimal:
abmi
ades
rf,f

little endian:
imba
seda
f,fr

_imbasedaf.fr


doing after the 3 threets 

_imbasedaf.fr010101010101
