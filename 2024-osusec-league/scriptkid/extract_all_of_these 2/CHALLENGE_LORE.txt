Challenge description:

This is Timmy's mom. Thank you for saving his computer and PWNing those pesky hackers!
Since little Timmy can't download RAM he will have to play older games like Roblox.
I found this "free Robux generator" on his hard drive and I'm almost certain its malware but I can't tell.
It appears to be obfuscated. Whether thats to hide malware, or to hide a top secret robux generation method, I'm not sure!

Do me a favor and find out if this is malware. If it is, please delete little Timmy's info from their server!
It might be harder than last time since these malware developers seem smarter, but all it takes is for them to make one mistake.
