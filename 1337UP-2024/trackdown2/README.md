## Solution

similar to trackdown 2 we are given an image with a few key indicators of where the image was taken, but this time it is a lot more vauge of an area, and vaguer indicators

using google reverse image search helps us narrow down the area to a few places, but the key indicator which I based my search off of was a church looking building in the background of the image.

In the picture we can also make out a few more indicators that will help us out: we can see a A25 hotel, a Simple Cafe, Little Hanoi EGG Coffee, and what looks to be a bus stop on the right side of the image.

searching up these things narrows down the correct angles and streets to look at.

this brought me to a street called: Le Lai, near a bus stop named Sai Gon Bus Station

From there it was a matter of finding the correct angles to match up everything and find the most likely spots he was staying, most likely a hotel

This part honestly took me the longest trying to find the right angles, going through google maps of different hotels, and the pictures to see if anything matched up.

using "The Simple Cafe" as a reference point, I was able to find the correct hotel, he was staying at, and an image listed on the google maps page matched up almost perfectly with the image given to us.

which got us to this location:  Express by M Village Ph·∫°m Ng≈© L√£o

trying this out as the flag gives us the correct flag:

```shell
INTIGRITI{Express_by_M_Village_Ph·∫°m_Ng≈©_L√£o}
```
